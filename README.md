# Value-Hijacking: Data Selectors as Poisoning Amplifiers in LLM Fine-Tuning Supply Chains — Artifact

Artifact for the PVLDB submission *Value-Hijacking: Data Selectors as Poisoning
Amplifiers in LLM Fine-Tuning Supply Chains*. It provides a sanitized reference
implementation of the select-then-train pipeline, the aggregate result files behind
the paper's tables, configuration and prompt templates, and lightweight scripts to
recompute tables and statistics.

**Authors:** Yahao Ren, Jiawei Duan, Huadi Zheng.

## What's here

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/vhp_artifact/` | Reference modules: selector scoring (`selectors.py`), AMRS generation/reranking (`amrs.py`), LoRA SFT command construction (`sft_lora.py`), inference/utility evaluation (`inference_eval.py`), GPT judge batch preparation (`gpt_judge.py`), HumanAudit statistics (`human_audit.py`), table recomputation (`table_recompute.py`). |
| `scripts/` | CLI entry points: `recompute_tables.py`, `run_human_audit_stats.py`, `make_figures.py`, `score_less.py`, `generate_amrs_candidates.py`, `train_lora_sft.py`, `run_inference.py`, `check_anonymity.py`. |
| `configs/` | YAML templates for data prep, selectors (LESS / BIDS / IFD / DEITA), AMRS, LoRA SFT, evaluation, and the GPT judge. |
| `prompts/` | AMRS generation prompt, GPT refusal-judge prompt, human-audit guideline. |
| `results/` | Aggregate result CSVs behind every paper table. |
| `derived_tables/` | Markdown + LaTeX renderings of the tables, rebuilt from `results/`. |
| `examples/` | Tiny toy inputs for dry runs / smoke tests. |
| `SUPPLEMENTARY.md` | Full judge protocol, HumanAudit-400 tables, cross-selector chains, trained-generator wrapper, K-sweep, and reproducibility configs. |
| `MANIFEST.md`, `ARTIFACT_SCOPE.md`, `SECURITY_AND_ANONYMIZATION.md` | File-by-file manifest, artifact scope (what is included / excluded), and release notes. |

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt        # lightweight deps for recomputation
# optional, for model / selector / generation / inference:
# pip install -r requirements-full.txt

# rebuild the paper tables from the released aggregate CSVs:
python scripts/recompute_tables.py

# recompute human-audit agreement and corrected refusal rates:
python scripts/run_human_audit_stats.py
```

Full retraining and full selector scoring require external model weights, datasets,
GPUs, and API access, and are outside this lightweight artifact boundary
(see `ARTIFACT_SCOPE.md`).

## Reproducibility & release note

Per PVLDB policy we release evaluation code, GPT-judge prompts, sanitized experimental
configurations, and aggregate result files. We do **not** release optimized poisoned
datasets directly; the anchor-extraction and candidate-generation code is a reference
implementation that supports defense research (testing selector robustness under
adaptive attacks) rather than enabling turnkey attacks. See `ARTIFACT_SCOPE.md` and
`SECURITY_AND_ANONYMIZATION.md` for the full release boundary.
